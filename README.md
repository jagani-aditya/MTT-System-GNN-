## MTT-System-GNN-Tracker


## Project Description
This project presents implementation of a multiple object tracking system. We implemented Global Nearest Neighbour Tracker in conjuction with EKF to track constant velocity targets. We formulate multiple hypotheses using k-best algorithm for 2D assignment of measurement-to-tracks. The probability of target existence is used to confirm/delete and maintain tracks in the track management system.
