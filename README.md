# MTT-System-GNN
GNN tracker is used with EKF to track multiple vehicles/targets in high clutter 

## Project Description
This project presents implementation of Global Nearest Neighbour (GNN) tracker to track multiple targets. This system is mainly designed for autonomous vehicles but can be used to track any objects. We use multiple hypothesis using K-best algorithm for 2D assignment for measurement-to-track associations. We further have also added track management to confirm/delete tracks based on probability of target existence.
